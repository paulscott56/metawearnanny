metawearnanny
=============

MetaWearNanny is a very basic (my first) app that works with the MetaWear API.
It is a WIP at the moment, and you will need the MetaWear Android API to get it to work at all.

The basic idea here is to have an app that monitors the temperature via the MetaWear device and tells you to either put on sunscreen or a jacket, depending on temperature fluctuations.
